The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [August 1, Wednesday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Re-build the NUTRiMOIST Landing Page, quite sleepy because I made it in the middle of the night after my son fell asleep.

### R1D2
Added some header to the previous project. Tried to make fix the position of the navbar using float. It was look cool but I had some difficulty in adding another element, so I guess I'll try to use Grid tomorrow.

### R1D3
Learned about the CSS Grid again from the lab.jensimmons.com and watched her videos about layout with Grids.

### R1D4
Tried to combine the CSS Grid with Flexbox, with some additional usage of floats for spesific elements.

### R1D5
Screwed all the things above! I tried to make some additional header to the products section but I guess it was failed. Hahaha

### R1D6
Played around with CSS selector:nth-child(), classes and IDs. Got stuck for about half an hour until I found out that I haven't include the style.css into the HTML file.

### R1D7
Tidying up the logs and see how far I went in this new rally. Found a links library on Jen Simmons' website. (https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/AEABOS-links)

### R1D8
No coding session. Got a severe headache and fever T_T

### R1D9
Felt much better and working on a webpage, combining the CSS Grid as scaffolding and flexbox as it's "cover". Finally had some better understanding about how to work them out together in a webpage. ^_^

### R1D10
Add some tweaks to the yesterday's webpage

### R1D11
Watched Grid and Flexbox video tutorials by Rachel Andrew and Jen Simmons. Learned a lot and still need more practice to sharpening my skill in building the web skin
